I can do this by subtracting 7 from one of the 13s: 13 - 7 = 6.\n\nNow, I have 6, 9, 13, and 7. Next, I'll try to find a pair of numbers to make 4. I can do this by dividing 13 by 9/3 (since 9/3 = 3, and 13/3 = 4 with a remainder of 1, but I can use the 7 to make up for the remainder): (9/3) * 7 = 4.\n\nNow, I have 6 and 4.

If I add 1 to 11, I get 12. Now, I need to find a way to make 1 using the remaining numbers 4 and 9.\n\nI can make 1 by subtracting 9 from 10, which is obtained by adding 4 and 6. But I don't have 6, so I'll try to find an alternative.\n\nWait, I can make 1 by subtracting 4 from 5, which is obtained by dividing 9 by 1.8 (approximately). But I don't have 1.8, so I'll try to find another way.\n\nAh, I can make 1 by dividing 4 by 4, which is 1!\n\nNow, I have 12 and 1. The product of 12 and 1 is 12, not 24. But I can multiply 12 by 2 to get 24. And I can make 2 by dividing 8 by 4.\n\nSo, here's my solution:\n\nFinal Answer: (8 - 3) * (4 / 4) * (9 / 4) = 24",

Since I have 13, I can make 1.2 by dividing 13 by 10. So, I have 10 * (13/10) = 13.\n\nNow, I need to make 2 using the remaining numbers, 7 and 1. I can do this by subtracting 1 from 7, which gives me 6, and then adding 1 to get 7 - 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, I'll multiply the results of steps a) and b) to get 24. I have 13 and 2, so I'll multiply them: 13 * 2 = 26, which is not 24. Let me try again.\n\nThis time, I'll make 12 by adding 10 and 2. I can make 2 by subtracting 5 from 7, which gives me 7 - 5 = 2. Now, I have 10 + 2 = 12.\n\nTo make 2, I'll divide 13 by 6.5 (which is close to 6.5). Since I have 1, I can make 6.5 by adding 5.5 to 1. So, I have (13 / (1 + 5.5)) = 2.\n\nNow, I'll multiply the results of steps a) and b) to get 24.

Let's see... 9 + 7 = 16, not 12. But, 10 - 7 = 3, and 9 - 2 = 7, so 3 + 7 = 10, not 12. Wait, 10 - 2 = 8, and 9 - 7 = 2, so 8 + 2 = 10, not 12. Ah, got it! 10 - 2 = 8, and 9 - 8 = 1, so 7 + 1 = 8, and 10 - 8 = 2.\n\nNow, I have the pair (8, 2) and I need to use them to make 12. Well, 8 + 2 = 10, not 12. But, 8 * 2 = 16, not 12. Wait, 8 / 2 = 4, and 4 * 2 = 8, not 12. Ah, got it! 8 / 2 = 4, and 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nFinally, I'll use 12 and 2 to make 24: 12 * 2 = 24.\n\nFinal Answer: (10 - 2) / (9 - 7) * (9 - 8) * 2 = 24",
